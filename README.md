This is a basic script telling you which hands you should continue with during preflop for a game of texas holdem. Although the script is rather basic, it follows GTO strategy given optimal ranges and positions. I wish I had the capability to code something much more complex, but I am already trying to do so on Java so this was a great change of pace! If anyone would ever like to talk about poker, and the decisions I made in the following script, I will be more than happy to. Again, this script is super basic, and doesn't really embody a full GTO preflop opening strategy, but it seeks to teach a begineer which hands to open with!


All you have to do is input a hand in the form of Ah5s (note 10=T) and else is all self-explanatory! Thanks for checking out this script.
